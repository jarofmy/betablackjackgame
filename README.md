# Beta Blackjack Card Game
This Blackjack simulation was created by utilizing Object-Oriented Programming in Python 2.7.

This is a basic player vs. dealer game of blackjack.

The player and dealer are both dealt 2 cards each. The dealer has one card shown and one card hidden. Both of the player's cards are shown. The player will then be prompted to either "hit" or "stand". The game ends one a player either chooses to stand, or busts 21. Face cards are worth 10, with Aces being worth either 1 or 11.

Note: A tie will always go to the house.
Hint: The dealer is programmed to stand at 17.
